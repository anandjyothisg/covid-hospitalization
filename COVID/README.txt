COVID-19 HOSPITALIZATION PREDICTION  MODEL:

This repository contains a logistic regression-based machine learning model to predict the likelihood of COVID-19 hospitalization. The model is trained on a dataset of patient health metrics and COVID-19 data to determine the probability of hospitalization based on various clinical and demographic features.

FEATURES:


Machine Learning Algorithm: Logistic Regression
Target Variable: Hospitalization status (binary: hospitalized or not hospitalized)
Input Variables: Health indicators such as age, comorbidities, symptoms, and vital signs
Feature Engineering: Handling missing data, feature scaling, and normalization to ensure robust predictions
Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and ROC-AUC to evaluate model performance

OBJECTIVE:

To assist healthcare providers in early identification of high-risk COVID-19 patients
Reduce strain on hospital resources by predicting potential hospitalizations based on patient data
Provide a quick and efficient decision-making tool during pandemic surges

TECNOLOGIES USED:

Python: For model implementation and data preprocessing
Pandas & NumPy: For data manipulation and handling
Scikit-learn: For building and evaluating the logistic regression model
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For visualizing model performance and data insights

HOW IT WORKS:

Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, applies feature scaling, and processes categorical variables.
Model Training: The logistic regression model is trained to classify whether a patient is likely to be hospitalized based on the input features.
Prediction: For a new patient, the model predicts the probability of hospitalization.
Model Evaluation: Performance is assessed using standard metrics such as confusion matrix and ROC curve.

HOW TO USE:
